"""On-device smoke tests for curl_cffi — the cffi bindings around curl-impersonate (a
patched libcurl + BoringSSL + nghttp2/3 + ngtcp2 + brotli + zstd + zlib, all statically
linked into the `_wrapper` extension).

They are network-free, exercising the compiled native library directly rather than
making an HTTP request, because an emulator or simulator has no guaranteed connectivity.
